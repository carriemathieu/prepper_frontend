### NOTE: This app uses the Web Speech API which is currently only supported in Chrome or Edge. ###
Please see [the MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API) for more info. <br /> 
#### How to play: <br/>
* Choose a category. In this version, you have the options to choose between the categories of "Ruby", "Rails", or "Javascript". 
* Select a list of words related to this category - the trick is you can only see the title, not the list of words! The title for each list of words gives you a clue to the difficulty of the list of words (i.e. "Intermediate Javascript" or "Ruby Basics").
* Click "ready", and accept access to the microphone through your browser. The Web Speech API will start listening. 
* You'll have 30 seconds to try and say as many words as you can that you think relate to the word list. 
* After 30 seconds, the timer will stop and you'll see your score and any words you missed.

Good Luck!
